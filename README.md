# ‚å®Ô∏è Customizable 3D-Printed Gaming Keyboard

**Engineering Internship Project | Jitterware Inc. | Fall 2024**

This project features a fully customizable mechanical keyboard, designed and prototyped using **Fusion 360** and optimized for **FDM 3D printing**. Engineered to support ergonomic and modular customization, the keyboard allows users to modify layout configurations, swap mechanical switches, and personalize the overall form factor through a parametric CAD-driven workflow.

## üîß Project Summary

As part of my engineering internship at **Jitterware Inc.**, I contributed to the mechanical design and iterative prototyping of a **3D-printed, gaming keyboard**. The project focused on developing a **modular, user-customizable chassis** that enables part replacement without tools, while maintaining tight tolerances required for switch alignment and PCB mounting.

The mechanical housing was designed to accommodate **standard MX-compatible switches**, with provisions for **RGB lighting diffusion**, **custom stabilizers**, and **snap-fit connections** for ease of assembly. The parametric model allows on-demand generation of various form factors, including 60%, 75%, and TKL layouts.
